# Blog

Welcome to my blog.

New posts live under this folder as Markdown files, for example:

- `docs/blog/hello-world.md`
- `docs/blog/my-new-post.md`

## Posts

- [Hello, world](hello-world.md)

To add a new post:

1. Create a new Markdown file in this directory, e.g. `my-new-post.md`.
2. Optionally add a bullet link to it in the list above.
3. Commit and push your changes to the `main` branch.

Once you push, GitHub Actions will build the site with MkDocs
and deploy it to GitHub Pages automatically.
