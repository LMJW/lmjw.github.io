Kubernetes cluster(KC) can be analogy to the conventional computational cluster, which includes many computers and to work as a single unit.
application runs on the KC needs to be containerized.
the program organizing the KC, namely Kubernete, manage the deployment and make containerized application run in KC in a more efficient way.
Kubernetes cluster structure Master ( act as a manager): coordinate the cluster Nodes (act as worker, the job of work is to run the containerize application) Master responsibilities : coordinate activities in cluster scheduling application maintaining application states scaling application rolling new updates Node(worker) definition of Node: A node can be a VM or a physical computer that serves as a worker machine in a KC.</description></item></channel></rss>
