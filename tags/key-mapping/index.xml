One thing I hate about is the keyboard mappings.
I want to basically do the following mappings
1 Caps lock key -&amp;gt; Left Ctrl key 2 Left Alt key -&amp;gt; Left Ctrl key 3 Left Windows key -&amp;gt; Left Alt key

For example, &amp;ldquo;Win+W&amp;rdquo; should suppose to map to &amp;ldquo;Alt+W&amp;rdquo; which corresponding to the &amp;ldquo;Copy&amp;rdquo; in emacs, however, it opens the &amp;ldquo;Pen&amp;rdquo; app in the Windows.
